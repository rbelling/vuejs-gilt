# Vue.js community

Vue was created by Evan You, a former google employee, who is now working full time on the framework. 
The community is growing really fast and has been supporting the development of new features, and even if the framework isn't backed by a large corporation, the [number of open issues](https://github.com/issues) on GitHub is really low comparing to other frameworks. 

# Market adoption
Big players that use vue (alibaba, optimizely)

# What's next

# Interesting use cases 
## Gilt admin tool
The admin tool at Gilt would greatly benefit from a do-over. With Vue, we could gradually refactor certain components, without having to redo the whole thing from scratch at one time.
Thanks to directives, it would be really easy to create tables and other repetitive layout elements that we have there. 

## Quicker turnarounds with designers thanks to single file components
In single file components you can easily edit the css (style block), without dealing with weird css-in-js which requires to have solid JS knowledge before being able to author css

With Vue, designers could easily edit the stylesheets, using their favorite tools (SASS / Less / PostCSS / ..). 
Also, because styles can be scoped, there's no risk of accidentally modifying other elements in the page.

## Trusted marketplace for Vue component

The idea of a marketplace for trusted plugins is certainly not new: it would be interesting to see something like Wordpress marketplace, where you could just add a component to your page without worrying about integrating it.
