## What's next?

### Gilt admin tool
The admin tool at Gilt would greatly benefit from a do-over. With Vue, we could gradually refactor certain components, without having to redo the whole thing from scratch at one time.
Thanks to directives, it would be really easy to create tables and other repetitive layout elements that we have there. 

###Trusted marketplace for Vue components

The idea of a marketplace for trusted plugins is certainly not new: it would be interesting to see something like Wordpress marketplace, where you could just add a component to your page without worrying about integrating it.
