## Vue.js community

Created by **Evan You** while he was working as a Creative Technologist at Google. 

Vue started as a personal project, to solve common challenges in the creative development.
The JS community needed a tool that make it quick to prototype and create highly interactive content.

Released to the public in **2014**, before Angular2 was out, and before React took off.
 
Gathered momentum after it was discovered by the Laravel community, it is now maintained full time by the creator, supported by a fairly big community 

It isn't backed by a huge corp, like React, but: 
* It has had 100% test coverage since the early days
* Very few open issues on GitHub, processed very quickly
* Breaking changes are rare 
  * There's usually a migration build, guiding you through the upgrade w/ deprecation warnings 
* Comes with MIT license (as opposed to React)
