## Vue.js community

Created by **Evan You** (former Creative Technologist at Google Creative Lab). 
Vue started as a personal project, to solve common challenges in the creative development, like the need for tools that make it quick to prototype, and creating highly interactive content.

Released to the public in 2014 (before Angular2) was out, and before React took off. 
Gathered momentum after it was discovered by the Laravel community, it is now maintained full time by the creator, supported by a fairly big community 

It isn't backed by a huge corp, like React, but: 
* It has had 100% test coverage since the early days
* Very few open issues on GitHub, processed very quickly
* Breaking changes are rare 
  * There's usually a migration build, guiding you through the upgrade w/ deprecation warnings 
* Comes with MIT license (as opposed to React)

## What's next?
### Gilt admin tool
The admin tool at Gilt would greatly benefit from a do-over. With Vue, we could gradually refactor certain components, without having to redo the whole thing from scratch at one time.
Thanks to directives, it would be really easy to create tables and other repetitive layout elements that we have there. 

With Vue, designers could easily edit the stylesheets, using their favorite tools (SASS / Less / PostCSS / ..). 
Also, because styles can be scoped, there's no risk of accidentally modifying other elements in the page.

###Trusted marketplace for Vue components

The idea of a marketplace for trusted plugins is certainly not new: it would be interesting to see something like Wordpress marketplace, where you could just add a component to your page without worrying about integrating it.
