#Intro

This should be a tldr of the presentation, very high level

- What's Vue.js
- Very high level comparison with angular and react.
- What does Vue shine on? Cons: it lacks something like React Native

#Vue.js at Gilt

Examples of real problems solved by Vue in Gilt

- web-category-page: What we needed from the framework
- Alan to talk about his use case
# Framework overview

Here we should provide a more in-depth overview of Vue features, e.g.:
- Progressive Framework
- virtual dom
- Directives
- Reactivity model (data, computed, watchers)
- Single File Components
#Vue.js community

Well supported, very few open issues. Ease of migrating to newer versions

#Market adoption
Big players that use vue (alibaba ecc)

#What's next

#Interesting use cases
At gilt, maybe recreate the Admin tool?
Also, a marketplace like Wordpress would work
