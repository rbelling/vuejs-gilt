## Getting Started
The final presentation is generated from `docs/presentation.md`.  

This file is not supposed to be edited manually: 
you can generate it by running `npm run dev`, which opens a browser tab with the result.

#### Partials concatenation
All the partials in `partials/*` will be included in the final output. The order is alphabetic.
