# Materials for Vue.js presentation at Gilt Architecture Council - Fall 2017

Please go to the GitHub page for the final [Presentation](https://rbelling.github.io/vuejs-gilt)

## Getting Started
The final presentation is generated from `docs/presentation.md`.  

This file is not supposed to be edited manually: you can generate it by running `npm run concat`, which is also automatically launched when committing something.

#### Partials concatenation
All the partials in `partials/*` will be included in the final output. The order is alphabetic.
